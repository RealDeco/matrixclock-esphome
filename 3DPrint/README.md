i found this free to download design a while back but been unable to find the link again to give proper credit for the work.

Some of these boards with 4x MAX7219 are a little longer than others, in case you have one that won't fit the standard frame, use the larger version, it contains a negativ block you only need to resize the length of and center it. then print.
the block is already resized to a board i got that was a little larger (131,76mm)
