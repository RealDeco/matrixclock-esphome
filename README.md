# üïí Matrix Clock with MAX7219

A simple yet nice-looking **Matrix Clock** built using **MAX7219 dot matrix displays** and esp32-c3 supermini.

Nothing groundbreaking here ‚Äî it‚Äôs just a digital clock that:

* Keeps time over NTP (or from home assistant)
* Listens to MQTT for messages
* Scrolls any received text across the display

## üìñ Background

I‚Äôve been using [this ESP8266 NTP Clock project](https://github.com/JXGA/ESP8266-NTP-Clock) for years and it works great for showing what is playing on the radio and so on..

This time, I wanted to run it on an **ESP32-C3 SuperMini** and instead of porting the old code, I wrote a simple **ESPHome YAML config** that replicates the same functionality.
